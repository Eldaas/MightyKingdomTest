# MightyKingdomTest // Clockerrr

This is a Windows application created with Unity engine for the purpose of demonstrating ability with programming and Unity.

The application features unlimited spawnable clocks, arranged on a UI canvas. Each clock has three possible modes: standard mode, timer mode and stopwatch mode. The first clock present in the scene upon loading is persistent and not removable. All other clocks can be deleted either by clicking the respective trash icon or by clicking the "Delete All Clocks" button. 

Standard mode:
This mode allows the user to select a desired UTC timezone from a list of dropdown options (collated from the system registry) and toggle between 12H and 24H display modes.

Timer mode:

Stopwatch mode:
This mode allows the user to start a counter from zero. The stopwatch counts in hours, minutes and seconds.
